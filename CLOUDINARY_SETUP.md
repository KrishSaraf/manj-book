## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes):

### **Step 1: Create Free Cloudinary Account**
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. You'll get your dashboard with your credentials

### **Step 2: Get Your Credentials**

2. Click **"Add upload preset"**
3. Set:
   - **Preset name**: `manj-book-uploads` (or anything you like)
   - **Signing Mode**: **Unsigned**
   - **Folder**: `manj-book` (optional, for organization)
4. Click **"Save"**

### **Step 4: Add to Netlify**

2. Go to `/admin` and create a new post
3. Upload an image - it will be stored on Cloudinary! ðŸ“¸
